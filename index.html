    <h2>About Avengers</h2>
    <P>The Avengers Initiative was the brainchild of S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Nick Fury.</P> <p>He first approached Tony Stark with the idea, following Tony’s defeat of Obadiah Stane and his subsequent public announcement that he was Iron Man.</P> <P>Fury kept his eye on several potential members, as Bruce Banner struggled with life as the Hulk</p>,<p> the Asgardian Thor appeared on Earth, and Steve Rogers, AKA World War II hero Captain America, was discovered alive decades after his apparent death.</P> <p>In the meantime, some of S.H.I.E.L.D.’s most skilled members, Black Widow (Natasha Romanoff), and Hawkeye (Clint Barton), were making a name for themselves and impressing Fury.</p>

       <p>Once the Asgardian trickster god Loki arrived on Earth and absconded with the massively powerful object known as the Tesseract—possessing Hawkeye and turning him into his brainwashed pawn</p><p>In the process—Fury found it necessary to finally bring together his potential super team, calling in Romanoff, Banner, Rogers and Stark.</p><p>Captain America and Iron Man, assisted by Black Widow, were able to capture Loki, but during their flight back to S.H.I.E.L.D.,</p><p> Thor arrived, attempting to bring his brother back to Asgard to face justice.</p><p> A fight ensued between Thor and Iron Man, but Captain America broke it up, and the group all returned with their prisoner, Loki, to the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier.</P>
